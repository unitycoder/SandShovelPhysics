# SandShovelPhysics
Prototype for testing sand digging with shovel.
Creates sand mesh based on shovel edge points that are underground.
"Merges" dropped sand mesh into high resolution ground mesh (by moving existing ground vertices upwards that amount).

### Usage
- Download this shovel model and place it inside Assets/Models/shovel.fbx https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-shovel-tool-1557857
- Press play, then move shovel inside Scene window (to dig ground)
- Then press C to release sand from shovel (then move shovel manually again to drop sand, if it didnt fall)
